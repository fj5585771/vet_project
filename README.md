### MVP

- The practice wants to be able to register / track animals. Important information for the vets to know is -
  - Name
  - Date Of Birth 
  - Type of animal
  - Contact details for the owner
  - Treatment notes
- Be able to assign animals to vets

### Extensions

- Many pets can be assigned to a single owner, and relevent information can be sensibly tracked.

### Future Extensions

- Appointment booking system adding extra functionality:
  - Handle check-in/out dates
  - Lets user see all animals currently in practice
